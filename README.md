A FFXIV Overlay for OverlayPlugin using HTML and JS

1. [About](#about)

## About

ZeffUI is an ACT overlay that provides  for [Final Fantasy XIV](http://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/). This project uses [cactbot](https://github.com/quisquous/cactbot/) and [ngld's OverlayPlugin](https://github.com/ngld/OverlayPlugin)
which are plugins for
[Advanced Combat Tracker](http://advancedcombattracker.com/).

ZeffUI is currently pretty customizeable and I'm hoping it's only going to get better!
